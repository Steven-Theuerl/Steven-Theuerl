# Hello <img src="./Ghost-T.png" alt="ghost" width="64" height="64" />

I'm making a living building things, and learning new ways to build new things with software.  
I love what I do, it's a passion, hobby, job, and lifestyle.  

My current focus is on fullstack platform development - using Next.js for the frontend,  
Node/Python/Rust for the backend depending on requirements, PostgreSQL for database work,  
and Ubuntu Linux on VPSs. I am interested in building datasets and agentic behaviors for AI,  
and much much more. My list of things I want to do is very large, and it's always getting bigger.
